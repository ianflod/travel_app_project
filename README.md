# Travel Tracker App

This app was built as a first solo project, over 5 days, during CodeClan's Professional Software Development Course.  The MVP of the App was to be able to track countries and cities visited.

## How to run

From the command line, cd into the project folder and enter

```bash
python3 console.py
```
Return to command prompt

```bash
q return
```
Start up Flask

```bash
flask run
```
The terminal will populate with information and you should see "* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)".  
```bash
Command and click the URL on the App should open.  
```
#### Alternatively, 
Go to the browser window and enter
```bash
localhost:5000  
```
